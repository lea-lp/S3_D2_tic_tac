# S3_D2_tic_tac

## Tic Tac Toe Ruby program w/ THP

We choosed to use 1 file.rb per class

-  Board
-  BoardCase
-  Player
-  Game

The last file tic_tac.rb runs everything into a `perform` method.

Enjoy !



*NB : to run the program correctly , please install the following gem*

`gem install colorize`
